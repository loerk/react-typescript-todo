while others care for important stuff i am building another todoapp:

# Taskify

This project is to practice state management with the React hooks useContext and useReducer while writing Typescript. Just a small app, nothing special, frontend only.

## Used packages

react-beautiful-dnd and @types/react-beautiful-dnd to implement the drag and drop behaviour.

To start the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

installs the dependencies 

### `npm run`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
